              The research phase consisted of asking questions to gain insights
              of how different people feel toward similar mentor websites,
              building personas from those insights, competetive audits, and
              conducting usability studies. This process reinfored the fact that
              connecting with the potential users is very important and
              beneficial for both the user and designer
              <br></br>
              Through this, I was able to determine what worked well with
              existing websites, and what did not. From this information I
              dertermined what needed to be included in my design

              Personas were made to help give a story and a face for potential
              user groups. The example below describes Addison. Addison is a
              recent college graduate who needs a mentor that shares her
              characteristics because it can be hard to connect and trust others
              who donâ€™t

              I conuducted a competetive audit to better understand what is
              already out there in the market. Through this, it was found that
              most of the other websites were similar to each other in what was
              being offered and the design. One website would not allow you to
              see more info unless you actually joined. This is something I
              would make sure not to due in our design
            </p4>

                Through the ideation process, it was important to keep the
                design simple yet effective. As always, it is important to think
                about the user. So designing a layout that has the best user
                flow possible was key

              Digital wireframes came next on the agenda. The goal was to make
              the design very clean. There is one clear purpose of this
              app/website and it is to find a mentor. We want to make that
              process as easy as possible
